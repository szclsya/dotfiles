You will need to install:
+ Font Awesome 4
+ xss-lock
+ i3blocks
+ picom
+ pamixer
+ dunst (if you want a notification daemon)
+ iw (for wireless information)
+ light
+ acpi (for battery information)

# Machine-specific adjustments
By default, i3blocks will use `BAT0`. If your main battery doesn't share this name, you may want to change the `BAT_NAME` setting in `scripts/battery`.

# Key bindings
+ Mod key is Alt
+ Mod + {hjkl} to move around windows, just like vim
+ Mod + b to switch to horizontal split (So the next window will be on the right)
+ Mod + v to switch to vertical split (So the next window will be on the bottom)

The rest of the keys should be identical to the default i3wm key binding.
